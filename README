NAME
    Task::BeLike::SHARYANTO::Devel - Install modules currently used in
    SHARYANTO's developing environment

VERSION
    version 0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This task will install modules currently used in all my developing
    environment. Not included are modules:

    *   already in 5.10 core;

    *   used in applications (see Task::BeLike::SHARYANTO::Apps);

    *   required by my very specific applications;

    *   required by my old/obsolete applications;

    The purpose of this distribution is to make it easy to setup my
    developing environment. Thus, this distribution is probably only useful
    to me or people who want to imitate my developing environment.
